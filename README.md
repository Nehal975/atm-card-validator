A simple program that validates ATM card numbers using the Luhn Algorithm. This project ensures that card numbers follow proper formatting and meet industry-standard validation criteria.

Features
Card Number Validation: Checks whether the card number is valid using the Luhn algorithm.
Card Type Detection: Identifies card types (e.g., Visa, MasterCard, etc.) based on predefined patterns.
Error Handling: Ensures user input is valid and provides helpful error messages.
